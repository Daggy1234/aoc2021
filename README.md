I continued using python to quickly solve the problem. Its easy and my language of choice. To run all the python solutions simply:

```sh
chmod +x runpy.sh
./runpy.sh
```

### Haskell

I've always wanted to explore FP and this was a good time too. 
Runn all Haskell solutions with ghc! Just run

```sh
chmod +x runhaskell.sh
./runhaskell.sh
```
