My solutions that work (hopefully)

## Languages Used

### Python3
I continued using python to quickly solve the problem. Its easy and my language of choice. To run all the python solutions simply:

```sh
chmod +x runpy.sh
./runpy.sh
```

### Haskell

I've always wanted to explore FP and this was a good time too. Working on a runner.

## License

Just follow the license, but honestly its way more fun solving these yourself!
